# ostad-DSA

This repository contains Dart implementations of algorithms and code examples demonstrating different time complexities for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning.

## Files

- **O(1).dart**: Examples of constant time complexity operations (O(1)).
- **O(n).dart**: Examples of linear time complexity operations (O(n)).
- **O(n^2).dart**: Examples of quadratic time complexity operations (O(nÂ²)).

## Usage

You can run each Dart file individually to see how the algorithms work and observe their time complexity in action.

```bash
dart O(1).dart
dart O(n).dart
dart O(n^2).dart
```

Feel free to explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of DSA concepts!
